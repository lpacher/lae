## Introduction
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

In the first lab we will implement and simulate a simple **NOT-gate (inverter)** using the **Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL)** <br />
and the **XSim simulator** that comes with the **Xilinx Vivado design suite**.<br/>

We will also learn how to write a [**GNU Makefile**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
to **automate the simulation flow** at the command line.


<br />
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->


## Lab aims
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

This introductory lab should exercise the following concepts:

* create and edit HDL sources and scripts with a text editor from the command line
* introduce Verilog language syntax fundamentals
* understand the Xilinx XSim simulation flow (HDL sources compilation, design elaboration and snapshot execution)
* add and trace signals in the XSim simulator Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* use basic XSim Tcl simulation commands to run a simulation interactively
* explore and debug simulation results
* use a Tcl script to automate the simulation
* write a `Makefile` to automate the flow at the command line

<br />
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->


## Navigate to the lab directory
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

As a first step, **open a terminal window** and change to the `lab1/` directory:

```
% cd Desktop/lae/fpga/labs/lab1
```

<br />

List the content of the directory:

```
% ls -l
% ls -la
```

## Write and compile HDL sources 
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

In order to implement and simulate our simple inverter we are going to write **two different Verilog modules**:

* one module containing the actual implementation of the inverter using **synthesizable code**
* a second **testbech module** that **instantiates** the previous module as **Device Under Test (DUT)** <br />
  and generates a suitable **test pattern** to verify the expected functionality of a NOT-gate


<br />

**DEVICE UNDER TEST (DUT) MODULE**

With a **text editor** program create a new file named `Inverter.v`.

Linux users can use the default **Gedit** text editor:

```
% gedit Inverter.v &
```

<br />

Windows users will use **Notepad++** instead:

```
% n++ Inverter.v
```

<br />

>
> **IMPORTANT !**
>
> In order to use the `n++` alias in place of `notepad++` you must create a `doskey` for the `notepad++.exe` executable
> in the `login.bat` script as described [here](../lab0/README.md#add-notepad-executable-to-search-path):
>
> ```
> doskey n++=notepad++.exe $*
> ```
>

<br />



Write the following **Verilog code** in the newly created file:

```Verilog
//
// A simple NOT-gate (inverter) in Verilog.
//


`timescale 1ns / 1ps   // specify time-unit and time-precision, this is only for simulation purposes

module Inverter (

   input  wire X,
   output wire ZN ) ;   // using 'wire' in the port declaration is redundant, by default I/O ports are already considered WIRES unless otherwise specified 


   // continuous assignment
   assign ZN = !X ;                // **NOTE: you can also use ~X

endmodule
```

<br />

Once finished, **save the file** and try to **parse and compile** the code using the `xvlog` Verilog compiler as follows:

```
% xvlog Inverter.v
```

<br />

In case of **syntax errors**, fix the errors issued in the terminal and re-compile the source file
after saving your changes.

By default the compiler creates a **log file** named `xvlog.log` in the directory where you invoke the `xvlog` executable.
Use `cat` to display the content of `xvlog.log` in the terminal:

```
% cat xvlog.log
```

<br />

Explore all **command-line switches and options** available for the `xvlog` compiler:

```
% xvlog -help
```

<br />



**TESTBENCH MODULE**

In order to **simulate** the block we also need a **testbench module** to create a
**test pattern** for our inverter.

Create a second Verilog file named `tb_Inverter.v` from the command line as follows:

```
% gedit tb_Inverter.v &   (for Linux users)

% n++ tb_Inverter.v       (for Windows users)
```

<br />

Write the following **non-synthesizable Verilog code** is the testbench file:

```verilog
//
// Simple testbench for the Inverter module.
//


`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module tb_Inverter ;

   reg in ;      // note that this is declared as 'reg' net type
   wire out ;

   // instantiate the device under test (DUT)
   Inverter DUT ( .X(in), .ZN(out) ) ;

   // main stimulus
   initial begin
   
      #500 in = 1'b0 ;
      #200 in = 1'b1 ;
      #750 in = 1'b0 ;

      #500 $finish ;     // stop the simulation (this is a Verilog "task")
   end

endmodule
```

<br />

Parse and compile with `xvlog` also the testbench:

```
% xvlog tb_Inverter.v
```

<br />


In case of **syntax errors**, fix the errors issued in the terminal and re-compile the source file
after saving your changes.

## Elaborate the design
[**[Contents]**](#contents)


The **compilation** process generates a **binary representation** of the HDL sources that only Xilinx tools
are now able to understand. This is basically the same thing that happens when you compile C/C++ sources at the
command line using `gcc/g++` compilers.

This binary representation goes into a so called **work library** placed in the `xsim.dir` directory
created by `xvlog`:

```
% ls -l xsim.dir/
% ls -l xsim.dir/work
```

<br />

In order to **simulate the testbench** we have at first to **merge together** the
compiled code of our module under test (the `Inverter` module) with the compiled code of the testbench module (the `tb_Inverter` module)
into a single **binary simulation executable**.
This process is called **design elaboration** and in the Xilinx XSim simulation flow this is performed
by the `xelab` executable. More in general, HDL sources can also instantiate other pre-compiled digital blocks, FPGA device primitives etc.
with a complex design hierarchy. Thus the elaboration process is also responsible to **resolve all external dependencies** found in the design.
Back to our comparison with C/C++ programming, design elaboration is what is called **linking** when compiling C/C++ sources.

The main argument for `xelab` is the **NAME of the top-level module** that you want to elaborate.
Apart from a few special cases that we will discuss later in the course, this is usually the **NAME of the testbench module**:

```
% xelab -debug all tb_Inverter
```

<br />

Be aware that the `-debug all` option is **REQUIRED** to make all signals in the design hierarchy **accessible** from the simulator
graphical interface in form of **digital waveforms**. That is, if you want to be able to **probe and display ALL signals as waveforms in the GUI**
you must elaborate the design with the `-debug all` flag. This is a feature common to all professional digital
simulators in order to **save disk space** when you deal with very large digital HDL projects (e.g. an entire CPU) where you don't need
to probe any single net in the design hierarchy.
If you elaborate compiled sources without this option **you will NOT BE ABLE to probe signals** in the XSim graphical interface!

<br />

>
> **IMPORTANT !**

> The value to be passed as main argument to the `xelab` executable is the **NAME** of the top-level module that has to be elaborated,
> **NOT the corresponding Verilog source file**! The following command-line syntax is therefore **WRONG** and generates errors:

> Do not call `xelab` targeting a `.v` file and **always pay attention to TAB completion on files**!

## Run the simulation executable
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

By default `xelab` creates a simulation snapshot with the same name of the top-level module specified for elaboration. <br />

To start XSim type:

```
% xsim -gui tb_Inverter
```

## Run Tcl simulation commands interactively
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

Once the simulation executable has been loaded into the XSim virtual memory we can finally **run the HDL simulation** in order to verify
the expected functionality for our inverter.

Before running the simulation we need to **probe all signals of interest** that we want to **trace as waveforms** in the XSim graphical interface,
otherwise the simulation will run but you will not see anything interesting. This can be easily done using the
`add_wave` simulation command in the **Tcl console**.

As an example, **probe all top-level signals** (testbench signals) using `add_wave` as follows:

```
add_wave /*
```

<br />

![](./doc/pictures/add_wave1.png)


<br />


This automatically creates a new **Waveform Configuration (WCFG) window** (by default named as "Untitled 1") that will
be used as a "virtual oscilloscope" to trace and debug digital signals in the graphical interface.

<br />

![](./doc/pictures/add_wave2.png)

<br />


Inspect the **help** for the `add_wave` simulation command:

```
add_wave -help
```

<br />

>
> **NOTE**
>
> It's always **up to the user** to select signals of interest to be traced before starting a digital simulation. <br />
> This is true also for other professional digital simulators.
>

<br />


After signals probing we can finally **run the digital simulation** either typing

```
run all
```

<br />

in the Tcl console or selecting **Run > Run All** in the graphical interface.


<br />

![](./doc/pictures/run_all.png)

<br />

As you can notice the simulator informs you that the simulation runs until the `$finish` Verilog task is found in the testbench code.


<br />

Display the full simulation time scale with **View > Zoom Fit**. Alternatively you can also left-clik anywhere in the Wave window
and **drag upper-left the mouse pointer**, then once you release the left button all waveforms automatically fit into the Wave window.

<br />

![](./doc/pictures/zoom_fit.png)
![](./doc/pictures/zoom_full.png)

<br />


Explore the graphical interface of the XSim simulator and debug simulation results.

<br />

>
> **QUESTION**
>
> Which is the logic value of the `in` signal before 500 ns ? Why ? <br /><br />
>
>   \____________________________________________________________________________________________________
>

<br />


Reset the simulation executable **back to time 0** using the `restart` command

```
restart
```

<br />

or through **Run > Restart**.

Now let's try to run the simulation only for the first 800 ns with:

```
run 800 ns
```

<br />

Query **logic values** of all testbench signals at current simulation time:

```
report_values /*
```

<br />

Print the current simulation time in the XSim Tcl console:

```
puts [current_time]
```

<br />


These commands provide a simple example of how you can run a simulation **interactively** using XSim **Tcl simulation commands**.

Close the simulator graphical interface once you are happy:

```
exit
```

<br />
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->


## Clean up the working area
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

The overall simulation flow (HDL sources compilation, design elaboration, snapshot execution)
created a lot of **log files** and other **temporary files and directories** in the `lab1/` directory:

```
% ls -la
```

<br />

It is always a **good practice** to have some **shell script** to easily **clean up the working area**
by deleting all those "garbage" files and scratch directories.
Later in the course  we will also introduce a **better working area organization** in order to keep
input design sources separated from flows output results.

Sample **cleanup scripts** `cleanup.sh` for Linux users and `cleanup.bat` for Windows users have been already prepared for you and
can be **copied** from the `.solutions/` directory using the `cp` shell command. To remove all log and temporary
files just `source` (Linux) or `call` (Windows) the proper script at the command line.


For Linux users:

```
% cp .solutions/cleanup.sh .
% source cleanup.sh
```

<br />

For Windows users:

```
% cp .solutions\cleanup.bat .
% call cleanup.bat
```

<br />

>
> **WARNING**
>
> Do not forget the dot `.` to indicate that the **target destination directory** for the `cp` command
> is the current working directory.
>

<br />

Explore the content of the script using the `cat` command:

```
% cat cleanup.sh      (for Linux users)

% cat cleanup.bat     (for Windows users)
```


<br />

>
> **NOTE**
>
> Just for reference. Since the `bash` executable is available also under Windows as part or the _GNU Win_
> package, Windows users can invoke the `cleanup.sh` script too as follows: 
>
> ```
> % bash cleanup.sh
> ```
>
> The recommended script to be used is the `.bat` indeed.
>

<br />

Later in this lab we will use a dedicated `Makefile` target to collect all "clean up" shell commands.

<br />
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->



## Use a Tcl script to automate the simulation
[**[Contents]**](#contents)


All **simulation commands** used to **probe signals to be traced** in the simulator
graphical interface and to **run the simulation** can be collected into a **Tcl script** that can be used
to **automate the simulation flow**.

With your **text editor** program create a new file named `run.tcl` :

```
% gedit run.tcl &   (for Linux users)

% n++ run.tcl       (for Windows users)
```

<br />

As a first example, write the following **Tcl code** in the new file:

```
##
## A first example Tcl simulation script for the Xilinx XSim simulator.
##


## profiling
set tclStart [clock seconds]

## add all top-level signals to the Wave window
add_wave /*

## run the simulation until a $stop or $finish statement is found in the code
run all

## print the overall simulation time on XSim console
puts "\nSimulation finished at [current_time]\n"

## report CPU time
set tclStop [clock seconds]
set seconds [expr ${tclStop} - ${tclStart} ]

puts "\nTotal elapsed-time for [info script]: [format "%.2f" [expr ${seconds}/60.]] minutes\n"
```

<br />


The proposed code contains **Xilinx-specific Tcl simulation commands** (`add_wave`, `current_time`, `run`) but also **native Tcl statements**
(`set`, `puts`, `clock`, `expr` etc.) to demonstrate how we can use the Tcl scripting language to automate and customize/extend
the simulation flow (in the example, track and report the script execution time for debug purposes).

Save the file once done and **relaunch the simulation** flow:

```
% xvlog Inverter.v tb_Inverter.v
% xelab -debug all tb_Inverter
% xsim -gui tb_Inverter
```

<br />

We can now `source` the `run.tcl` **script** from the XSim **Tcl console** in order to automatically select
top-level signals to be plotted and run the simulation:


```
source run.tcl
```

<br />

![](./doc/pictures/source_run_tcl.png)

<br />

By default `source` also prints in the Tcl console all Tcl statements that are executed as comments (a comment always starts with the `#` character in Tcl).
You can **suppress the command echoing** by adding the `-notrace` option as follows:

```
source -notrace run.tcl
```

<br />

To further save time, the `run.tcl` script can be also automatically executed by XSim at startup
using the `-tclbatch` option when invoking the `xsim` executable at the command line:

```
% xsim -gui -tclbatch run.tcl tb_Inverter
```

## Create a Makefile to automate the flow
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

Up to now we learned how to compile HDL sources, elaborate the design and run a simulation snapshot
by invoking `xvlog`, `xelab` and `xsim` **standalone executables** at the command line each time.

A more efficient solution would be to **automate the simulation flow** by collecting these commands inside
a [**GNU Makefile**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) parsed by the `make` utility.

For this purpose, create a new text file named `Makefile` (without extension):

```
% gedit Makefile &   (for Linux users)

% n++ Makefile       (for Windows users)
```

<br />

Then enter the following source code:

```make
##
## A first Makefile example to automate the Xilinx XSim simulation flow. 
##

## list of Verilog sources to be compiled
SOURCES := Inverter.v tb_Inverter.v


## top-level module (testbench)
TOP := tb_Inverter


## some useful aliases
RM := rm -f -v
RMDIR := rm -rf -v


## compile Verilog sources (xvlog)
compile :
        @xvlog $(SOURCES) -log $@.log


## elaborate the design (xelab)
elaborate :
	@xelab -debug all $(TOP) -log $@.log


## run the simulation (xsim)
simulate :
	@xsim -gui -tclbatch run.tcl $(TOP) -log $@.log


## one-step compilation/elaboration/simulation
sim : compile elaborate simulate


## delete all log files and simulation outputs
clean :
        @$(RM) *.log *.jou *.pb *.wdb *.wcfg
        @$(RMDIR) xsim.dir .Xil
```

<br />

> **IMPORTANT !**
>
> According to `Makefile` syntax, instructions inside each target **MUST BE IDENTED USING A TAB CHARACTER !**
>
> ```
> target :
>
> <TAB> @write here some cool stuff to be executed
> ```
>
> **DO NOT USE SPACES TO IDENT TARGET DIRECTIVES !**
>

<br />

Save and exit. Try to run the flow with:

```
% make clean
% make compile
% make elaborate
% make simulate
```

<br />

For less typing, this is equivalent to run:

```
% make clean sim
``` 

<br />

As already noted once `xsim -gui` is invoked **the shell hangs** and we are not able to type commands in the terminal anymore.
In order to allow to **launch the command in background also under Windows** we can forward to `tclsh`
the execution of the command as follows:


```make
simulate:
	@echo "exec xsim -gui -tclbatch run.tcl $(TOP) -log $@.log &" | tclsh -norc
```

<br />

Close XSim and update the `simulate` target in the `Makefile`, then try to relaunch the simulation without re-compile/re-elaborate the design
from scratch:

```
% make simulate
```

<br />

## Exercises
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

<br />

**EXERCISE 1**

Open the `Inverter.v` file with your text editor application and modify the **continuous assignment** in order
to **add 3 ns propagation delay** between input and output:

```verilog
assign #3 ZN = !X ;
```

<br />

Save the file once done. Re-compile and re-simulate the code. Look at waveforms to verify if the delay has been properly
included in the simulation.

<br />

>
>**IMPORTANT !**
>
> The proposed Makefile-based automated flow **suffers from an important drawback**. That is, the compilation/elaboration/simulation flow
> **cannot be re-invoked** from the XSim graphical interface after RTL or testbench changes, thus requiring to exit from the GUI and re-build
> the simulation snapshot from scratch. This happens because XSim doesn't keep track of `xvlog/xvhdl` and `xelab` flows.
>
> Later in the course we will see how to solve these issues by moving all calls to standalone executables into **Tcl scripts**
> executed by `tclsh` from `Makefile`.
>

<br />

**EXERCISE 2**

Comment-out the original implementation of the inverter and replace it with a **MUX-style conditional assignment** as follows:

```verilog
//assign #3 ZN = !X ;
assign ZN = (X == 1'b1) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1 ;
```

<br />

Save the file once done. Re-compile and re-simulate the code.
Verify if the functionality of the NOT gate has changed.

<br />

**EXERCISE 3**

Further modify the implementation of the inverter and replace the previous conditional assignment with a true instance of a **NOT-gate**
using the `not` **gate primitive** provided by the Verilog language:


```verilog
//assign #3 ZN = !X ;
//assign ZN = (X == 1'b1) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1 ;

// gate-primitive instantiation
not  u1 (ZN , X) ;   
```

<br />

This is a first example of a **gate primitive instantiation**, and the resulting Verilog code basically represents a true **schematic**
with a NOT-gate symbol.

You can also add some **propagation-delay** to the `not` gate-primitive with the following syntax:

```verilog
// gate-primitive instantiation + 3ns propagation delay
not #(3) u1  (ZN , X) ;
```

<br />

Save the file once done. Re-compile and re-simulate the code.
Verify if the functionality of the NOT gate has changed.

<br />

**EXERCISE 4**

Create a new source file `BufferTri.v` and try yourself to implement a **three-state buffer** using a C-like
**conditional assignment** and an active-high output-enable `OE` control port:

```verilog
assign Z = (OE == 1'b1) ? X : 1'b1z ;
```

<br />

Re-use and extend the original inverter testbench code to simulate and verify the expected functionality.

<br />
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->


## Extra: comparison with VHDL code
[**[Contents]**](#contents)

Compare the Verilog implementation of our inverter with its VHDL equivalent:

```vhdl

--
-- A simple NOT-gate (inverter) in VHDL.
-- 


-- include extended logic values (by default VHDL only provides 0/1 with the 'bit' data type)
library ieee ;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all ;


entity Inverter is

   port (
      X  : in  std_logic ;
      ZN : out std_logic
   ) ;

end entity Inverter ;


architecture rtl of Inverter is

begin

   ZN <= not X ; 

end architecture rtl ;
```

<br />

Interested students can also try to simulate a **mixed-languge** design by compiling the inverter as VHDL using the `xvhdl` compiler, while
parsing the Verilog testbench with `xvlog` as before.
For this purpose, create a new `Inverter.vhd` VHDL file and write the above code.

Save and exit once done. To run the flow use:

```
% rm -rf *.log *.jou *.pb *.wdb xsim.dir .Xil
% xvhdl Inverter.vhd
% xvlog tb_Inverter.v
% xelab -debug all tb_Inverter
% xsim -gui -tclbatch run.tcl tb_Inverter
```
